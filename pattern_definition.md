# Organisational Patterns

So what would an organisational pattern look like?

To be useful it would need to describe how the pattern affects the success of the organisation. This is a difficult
thing to pin down, but we can propose a very broad definition that does not contain any value judgement, as this will be
very specific to each organisation. We can say that “the success of an organisation is defined by the actions that
people take, and the value (however defined) derived from those actions”. If nobody performs any actions in the
organisation, then it will not create any value. Maximising the number of actions that are taken, and maximising the
value derived from each action will result in the greatest business value.

In order to take actions, we must also make decisions. Decisions made by people in the organisation affect the number
and quality of actions that can be taken. Poor quality decisions (or lack of decisions) may lead to actions that deliver
low levels of value, or to fewer actions being taken.

So we have a definition of success which is to maximise the quality of decision making, so that we maximise the number
of actions we can take, and maximise the value we gain from each action.

However, this is not enough to describe a pattern. Any pattern will also have some constraints that must be true for the
pattern to function. If any of these constraints are not met, then the pattern will not deliver the benefits (or
drawbacks) to decision making and actions that we expect. A specialist who does not have the right skills to perform
their role will not be very useful for the organisation. A decision maker will not be very effective if they have no
free capacity to make decisions.

Our definition of an organisational pattern should include the following:
* A description of the pattern
* A list of constraints that must be true for the pattern to function
* A list of the effects that this pattern will have on the wider organisation
