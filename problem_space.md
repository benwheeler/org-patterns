# The Organisational Problem Space

Often we come across wasteful practices in organisations that limit their ability to deliver business value. These can
result in an upper bound to how effective any team can be within that organisation.

Usually it is hard to know where to start with this problem. Organisations are complex systems, made up of both visible
and invisible parts. The formal structure of an organisation may be clear, and approximated by some form of
organisational chart. There will be many more informal parts that we cannot see, which may make our problem intractable.

However, if we break an organisation down to a granular enough level, we end up with a set of people playing one or more
roles, joined together with relationships. These roles are not entirely random, there are many similarities between
roles that different people play. Each person will play the role their own way, but if we make some generalisations we
may find our problem is more tractable.

If we had a common language to describe organisational roles, and an understanding of the fundamental properties of how
that role affects the work done within the organisation, we could propose solutions to optimising the types of work that
deliver success (however that is defined) for that organisation. This language might also help us identify any roles
that work against or degrade the overall success of the organisation.

The idea of design patterns has been around for a long time, and may seem completely inappropriate to apply to dynamic
systems composed of people. We canâ€™t just describe someone as playing pattern _X_ and expect all people of pattern _X_
to behave the same way. But if we relax the definition of a design pattern to make space for variation, for bias and for
unpredictability, then maybe we can apply pattern thinking to our problem space.
